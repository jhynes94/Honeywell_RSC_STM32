# Honeywell_RSC_STM32
Honeywell RSC Sensor Library for STM32

## Notes
Datasheet: https://sensing.honeywell.com/honeywell-sensing-trustability-rsc-series-data-sheet-32321348-c-en.pdf

Example project https://github.com/ij96/Honeywell_RSC is based on https://github.com/ij96/Honeywell_RSC/blob/master/src/Honeywell_RSC.cpp

There is also https://sensing.honeywell.com/sensors/amplified-board-mount-pressure-sensors/trustability-rsc-series Which has a file called Comp.zip

This seems to be for other sensors such as the HSC
